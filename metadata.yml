Title: FASTSOLV solubility prediction
Description: Prediction of organic solubility using deep learning on fixed 
  Mordred-based representations. The authors test the models under rigorous 
  solute extrapolation conditions, outperforming existing methods and 
  demonstrating prediction accuracy near the intrinsic aleatoric limit of 
  experimental data.
